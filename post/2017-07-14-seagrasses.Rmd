### What are they?

Exactly what they sound like, grasses that grow under water!  While often mistaken for seaweed, they are actually more similar to the grass in your yard.  They have roots, stems and leaves, and produce flowers and seeds, plus they need light to grow.  Unlike your lawn though, they grow completely submerged in water.

There are about 52 species of seagrass worldwide, growing as far north as the Arctic Circle, but in Florida and around the Gulf Coast there are seven.  The distribution of the difference species varies based on their preferred range of salinity, turbidity, and light requirements, but I'll get into that more in the next section.

Most seagrasses produce sexually and asexually.  Their asexual reproduction is clonal, meaning that many of the plants in a seagrass meadow may appear to be individual, but are actually a part of the same plant, with a network of underground rhizomes supporting individual shoots.  These shoots will all have the same genetic code too!  This kind of growth is exhibited by terrestrial species such as aspen trees and blueberry bushes.  Sexual reproduction occurs via pollination, but as you might imagine, there is a noticeable lack of bees under the sea, so pollinations is aided by water movement; small invertebrates can help with this process as well. Seagrass seeds can be spread by water flow, but also by animals, such as fish and turtles, eating and excreting them.

### Where are they?
Seagrasses distribution is dictated by their light and salinity requirements.  Of the six seagrass species found in the Gulf, all six occur in Florida, and they are:

- Turtle Grass (*Thalassia testudinum*)
- Manatee Grass (*Syringodium filiforme*)
- Shoal Grass (*Halodule wrightii*)
- Paddle Grass (*Halophila decipiens*)
- Star Grass (*Halophila engelmanni*)
- Wigeon Grass (*Ruppia maritima*)


Most of these species are found Gulf-wide, in varying densities.  Shoal grass and turtle grass are prevalent Gulf-wide; paddle grass is extensive in south Florida; star grass is common in Florida but is less common in the northern Gulf, only being found off of the Chandeleur Islands, Louisiana; you'd think manatee grass was only in Florida, considering that's the only place manatees can be found in the Gulf, but it also occurs in south Florida; and widgeon grass, which is common in estuaries that are heavily influenced by freshwater, it's the only species that can growth in both freshwater and saline environments.
